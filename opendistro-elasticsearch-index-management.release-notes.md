This is the first official release of Open Distro Index Management plugin.

With Index State Management you will be able to define custom policies, to optimize and manage indices and apply them to index patterns.
Each policy contains a default state and a list of states that you define for the index to transition between.
Within each state you can define a list of actions to perform and transitions to enter a new state based off certain conditions.
